- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrenchMocha
- 👀 I’m interested in reading.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
- 📫 How to reach me? I'll reach you...


1. Previous coding Experience:
   - C++: C++ for dummies
   - Python: from Codecademy
   - Java: from Codecademy
   - Javascript?: Littlebit from Codecademy
2. I want to know more about coding, and have tasks to code. I find coding interesting. My father works in IT.
3. I want to get better in coding for science, and increase my knowledge in the field. Make my own projects.
4. Goals? I want to try to make something that could benefit me in the future. A program that will transfer a photo of charts or a screenshot of charts into a digital copy of said chart.
Code for measuring Viscocity? Simple program for viscocity? A bug identifier? Storing data on URL from specific users? 
5. I worry that I do not have the skills to create a suitable GUI for this level of programming. I worry I don't know enough of a specific code to complete a project.
I worry that I might not do well in the class.
